# 24hTrading - short intro

24hTrading was born as static site developed in html/css with bootstrap framework. Some times later the company which commission the project told me to convert it and add the 'wordpress' side because in the future they may want to customize it. If you are interested to see the template without wordpress write me (my email is in bio).
